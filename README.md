Form Validation

Form HTML and CSS was provided, but handling validation of data was done using HTML and RegEx expressions.

Notes on customized form validation customization

The name field is put through three regular expressions and provides feedback based on three conditions

1. if the name field is empty
2. if the name field start with a letter
3. if the name consists of only letters and whitespace
